Enhanced media manager for Isotope
-----------------------------
Adds some extra functionality to managing images in Isotope.

## Usage
In order for the features to work, the "Enhanced gallery" type must be selected when setting up your product galleries in the Store Configuration.

## Features

### Set the main image manually
By default, the main product image is determined by the sort order. This module adds a checkbox so that the main image can be specified, making the main image selection independent of the sorting.

### Image visibility
Adds the ability to show/hide images product without deleting them.
